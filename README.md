# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs

## Project Overview

We have created a map that displays earthquakes, a major earthquake, and tectonic plate outlines to display the concentration 
of the quakes as well as relative location to the tectonic plate boundaries.  Use circle markers scaling the size and color
based on the earthquake magnitude.    
The map has a color legend for the magnitude and the layer icon opens to allow complete customization on the data displayed
along with optional mapping backgrounds.
